# CNE-Project-2

## Brief

The goal of this project is to efficiently deploy a flask application. The code for the application was provided by the breif and I am required to engineer a **continuous integration pipeline** that encompasses all of the technologies learned in the module since the last project.

## Requirements

* Jira board will all tasks needed to complete the project
* Application deployed using containerisation and orchestration tools
* Application must be tested through the CI pipeline
* The project must make use of two managed database servers. One for testing and one for production
* Webhooks must be used so that Jenkins automatically deploys the updated application
* The infrastructure for the project should be configured using an infrastructure management tool
* The project must use an Anisible Playbook that provisions the environment for the CI server.
* The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.

## Constraints

These are the technologies that must be used:
* Kanban Board: Jira
* Version Control: Git
* CI Server: Jenkins
* Configuration Management: Ansible
* Cloud Server: AWS EC2
* Database Server: AWS RDS
* Containerisation: Docker
* Reverse Proxy: NGINX
* Orchestration Tool: Kubernetes
* Infrastructure Management: Terraform
